Project Title: Optimal Route Planning with Similarity Measures - BMHK Solutions

Overview:

This repository contains the code and data for a university project aimed at developing an optimal route planning solution. The project involves analyzing a dataset of speed forecasts and historical routes to find the best path between two points in a city, considering both optimality and similarity to past routes. The project is conducted as part of the Project Seminar: Optimisation at Friedrich–Alexander Universität Erlangen–Nürnberg, Department of Data Science.
