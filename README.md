Project Title: Optimal Route Planning with Similarity Measures

Overview:

This repository contains the code and data for a university project aimed at developing an optimal route planning solution. The project involves analyzing a dataset of speed forecasts and historical routes to find the best path between two points in a city, considering both optimality and similarity to past routes. The project is conducted as part of the Project Seminar: Optimisation at Friedrich–Alexander Universität Erlangen–Nürnberg, Department of Data Science.

How to use our code:
1. Download all the necessary packages:
   - pandas
   - warnings
   - csv
   - matplotlib.pyplot
   - numpy
   - collections
   - sklearn.preprocessing
   - pickle
   - sklearn.cluster
   - sklearn.neighbors
   - heapq
   - networkx
2. In your main function also import the function call_bmhk_algo from call_bmhk_algo and call it with your instance. The output is the time in minutes for the optimal route and also the path as an array of nodes.
